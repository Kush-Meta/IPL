# IPL
This is a repository where I clean and code a data repository with IPL Data to create a model to predict IPL outcomes using historic data
The paramters used in the model are: match outcome, venue, team distribution and over progression
The aim for this project is to help me learn Machine Learning using cricket, an interest of mine
This project is of significance as we are in the middle of the 2025 IPL Season
